0. Resolve all of the warnings (use 'constructor' syntax for constructors, add emit keyword when emiting events);
1. Delete MemberContr - insted just use the Member struct;
2. Remove MemberContr add method;
3. Remove tmp state variables - they are no longer used after removing the add method;
4. Remove members list - unused state variable;
5. Optimize onlyMember modifier - we can just check whether the msg.sender is part of our members mapping;
6. Use the Member struct where the MemberContr was previously used;
